This repository is a javascript project that creates a javascript bundle that is an in-browser javascript module (explanation on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxqiu6pdMSU&list=PLLUD8RtHvsAOhtHnyGx57EYXoaNsxGrTU&index=2)). The currently deployed version of the in-browser module can be seen at https://react.microfrontends.app/importmap.json.

This project uses [React](https://reactjs.org) and was created with the [create-single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/create-single-spa) CLI. It uses webpack and babel.
